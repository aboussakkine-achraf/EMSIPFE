This project use  MERN stack architecture that is a powerful, full-stack JavaScript solution designed to simplify and streamline the development process of modern web applications. Comprising MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, each component of the MERN stack serves a specific purpose. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, stores application data in a flexible, JSON-like format. Express.js, a lightweight web application framework, handles server-side logic and routes. React, a popular front-end library, enables developers to build dynamic user interfaces with reusable components. Node.js, a runtime environment, allows JavaScript to be used on the server side, ensuring seamless integration between the server and client. Together, these technologies enable the creation of robust, scalable, and maintainable applications with a consistent JavaScript codebase throughout.
